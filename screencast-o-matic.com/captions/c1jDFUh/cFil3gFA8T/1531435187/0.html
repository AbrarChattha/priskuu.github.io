Let's go over how to manage your recordings.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.179
When you make a recording, it's saved on your local
computer. By default, these recordings are stored under your documents ...

3
00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.588
folder, but you can organize it into separate folders by
clicking the folder icon in the upper left corner to ...

4
00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:24.623
switch between folders you've used, or browse to select a
new folder.

5
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:33.184
When you are viewing a folder, you'll have options to
create recordings, import recordings, search for recordings, or to modify ...

6
00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:35.348
how the recordings are displayed.

7
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.848
For example, the current view is sorted to show recordings
based on when they were last modified, putting most recently ...

8
00:00:41.848 --> 00:00:43.252
modified recordings first.

9
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.886
It will group recordings based on time, as we see
with this "last week" group. You can click on "Show ...

10
00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:53.393
all" to expand a group if there are more recordings
not visible.

11
00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.180
You can manage the recordings in this current folder by
clicking on the "manage recordings" box.  This will give ...

12
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.274
you the option to copy, move, export or delete recordings
from this folder.

13
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.447
Export means to compress a recording into a .somrec file,
which you can then transport to another computer and use ...

14
00:01:10.447 --> 00:01:12.733
the import option to import that recording.

15
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.157
To perform one of these actions, you'd first select the
recording, and then choosing an action button. For example, if ...

16
00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:25.807
we "copy" this recording, we will get a list of
folders we've previously used or the option to browse for ...

17
00:01:25.807 --> 00:01:26.622
another folder.

18
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.739
Or we can delete this recording, which will mark it
for deletion, but the actual deletion doesn't happen unless you ...

19
00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:39.209
close the application. Or you can come up here you
and to choose to "undelete" or "commit delete" to trash ...

20
00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:40.511
the recording right away.
