00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.600
We've made it easy for you to import and insert
an mp4 into your video.

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.840
There are two ways to import an mp4 video file.

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.368
First you can click on the 'import' button on your
video editor, choose the mp4 and click to upload the ...

4
00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:20.720
whole file.

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:28.571
Or if you're choosing to insert an mp4 into your
video, head to your editing controls, click on tools, click ...

6
00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:32.483
insert then click 'video file' and choose your mp4

7
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.977
This option is useful when you want to add an
intro video that you've already created.

8
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.713
Just a couple things to note when importing a video
file.  Some editing options may not be available.

9
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.480
Let's show you an exampleâ€¦

10
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.985
Here's a screen recording we just created.  When you
go into this recording, you'll notice options to edit the ...

11
00:00:55.985 --> 00:00:57.625
cursor or webcam.

12
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.804
When we publish this recording into an mp4 video file
and then import that file to be used in another ...

13
00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:08.489
video, you will no longer have the option of editing
the cursor or webcam from this video.  Those are ...

14
00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:14.458
baked into the video file when you published the recording.
You won't see any of the original edits you've ...

15
00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:18.665
made prior to publishing since that information isn't contained in
the mp4.

16
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.528
Take note that the audio for the video file will
show up as 'Computer Audio.'

17
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.320
You can continue editing your video with new edits.

18
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.280
