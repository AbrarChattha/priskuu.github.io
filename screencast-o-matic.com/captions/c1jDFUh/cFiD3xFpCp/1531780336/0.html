00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.431
Premier Hosting lets you create your own screencasts site so
you can show off screencasts for your business or school ...

2
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:12.966
without ads and your own branding.

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.187
To setup your Premier Hosting make sure you are logged
in with your account and from your Hosting Tab click ...

4
00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:21.204
the Settings button to get started.

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.156
First choose the logo you'd like to show on your
site by uploading a logo image from your local computer.

6
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.163
If you choose to show a logo then you also
have the option of making it a link by setting ...

7
00:00:34.163 --> 00:00:34.550
a URL.

8
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.405
Next you can choose what domain to use for your
screencast site.

9
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.555
If you don't what to use a custom domain then
you can leave it set at "None" which will just ...

10
00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:51.472
use the normal screencast-o-matic.com domain for your screencast links but
won't give you the option of having a custom site.

11
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.365
If you want to setup a custom site then you
have 2 options.  The first is to create a ...

12
00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:01.465
custom subdomain under our generic screencasthost.com domain.

13
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:11.205
For example we can enter a subdomain like mybusiness then
links will look like they are hosted under mybusiness.screencasthost.com

14
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.858
Another option if you already have a web site domain,
is to create a CNAME alias so screencasts look like ...

15
00:01:17.858 --> 00:01:20.715
they are hosted from a subdomain on your site.

16
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.125
To set this up you first need to enter the
full host name you'd like to use which in our ...

17
00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:30.155
example is "screencasts.mybusiness.com".

18
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.343
Then you need to go to your DNS settings for
your domain and add a CNAME that points the subdomain ...

19
00:01:37.343 --> 00:01:39.941
"screencasts" to "screencast-o-matic.com".

20
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.248
For more info about setting up a CNAME please contact
the DNS provider for your domain.

21
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.840
When you use one of these custom domain options then
you also get to choose what to show on the ...

22
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.602
homepage for your custom site.

23
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.840
You can choose to show a blank page.

24
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.960
You can choose to show a channel you've created.

25
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.135
You can choose to show a list of your most
recent uploads with a search bar.

26
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.813
And finally you can choose to show a list of
channels with a search bar.

27
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.939
If you choose this last option then you'll also need
to go and choose which channels will show by editing ...

28
00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.803
a channel and clicking this box.

29
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.813
Next you can setup a name for your site which
will show as the title in the browsers tab.

30
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.653
And finally if you have Team Premier Hosting then you
can choose to Require Login to access your site.  ...

31
00:02:36.653 --> 00:02:42.314
If you choose to enable this then all access to
your site will be protected so it will require a ...

32
00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:46.276
login by an authorized user on your Premier Hosting to
view the screencasts.
