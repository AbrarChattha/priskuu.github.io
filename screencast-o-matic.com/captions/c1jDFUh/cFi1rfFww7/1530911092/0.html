Let's show you how to animate a zoom using edit
points.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.629
In this recording, we want to be able to zoom
in on a certain area, hold for a few seconds, ...

3
00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.375
and then zoom back out.

4
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.569
To start, let's drag the bar in the timeline where
you want the zoom to begin.

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.256
Click anywhere in the recording to bring up this "main
video" menu.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.484
Go to preview window and use the handles to zoom
into the area you want. You can drag the box ...

7
00:00:30.484 --> 00:00:31.670
to re-position if needed.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.406
Then, click on this icon here to make your first
edit point.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.166
This bar here indicates the gradual ease of the zoom.
By default, it's at 1 sec but you can increase ...

10
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.225
or decrease that time here.

11
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.120
You can preview your edit by clicking here.

12
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.104
Next, we move ahead a few seconds in the timeline
to indicate where we want to start zooming back out.

13
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.295
Go back to the preview window and you can either
use the handles to drag it back out to full ...

14
00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:09.287
screen or you can simply click the reset button here.

15
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:17.464
Here, we will make our second edit point. Preview your
edit point and if it looks good, click "ok" or ...

16
00:01:17.464 --> 00:01:19.318
enter on your keyboard.

17
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.313
You can also use these edits points to animate other
overlays such as a moving arrow, image or text box.
