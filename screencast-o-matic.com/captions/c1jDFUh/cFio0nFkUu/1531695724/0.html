Let's show you how to modify the volume levels over
a section of your recorded video.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.176
First, go to the point on your timeline where you
want to adjust the volume.

3
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.488
Click on "Tools" and select "Volume" or you can just
press the "V" key to start the tool

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.303
Select the section to adjust by dragging the pink bar
along the timeline. Or if you click on the start ...

5
00:00:25.303 --> 00:00:28.829
or end of the span, you can use the arrow
keys to fine-tune it.

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.769
On this recording, we have both narration and computer audio.
To modify, choose which audio you'd like to edit.

7
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.810
Clicking "Narration" we get options to reset the levels if
we previously changed them, then, there are buttons to increase ...

8
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.324
or decrease the levels, or to silence the section completely,

9
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.601
When you make a change, you will see the levels
on the timeline change. The icon here will also change ...

10
00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:55.797
to show that an adjustment was made.

11
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.617
To preview what the new volume sounds like, press the
"Preview" button here.

12
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.123
When you are ready to commit, click the "Okay" button
to save it.

13
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.492
A colored span will show on the timeline where the
audio level change was applied. If you want to edit ...

14
00:01:10.492 --> 00:01:15.905
or remove the adjustment, you can seek back to that
spot on the timeline, then click this icon, and it ...

15
00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:18.585
will bring back up the controls so you can revise.

16
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.680
Thank you for watching this tutorial.
