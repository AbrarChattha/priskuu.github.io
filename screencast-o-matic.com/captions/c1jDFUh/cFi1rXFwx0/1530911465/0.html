00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.160
Here's how to add music to your video.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.334
You can use music from the Screencast-O-Matic stock library OR
import your own.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.777
Once you've finished your recording, you will see a music
icon next to the timeline.

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.366
Click on this icon to see a menu of music
in the stock library.

5
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.297
Or you can switch to see a list of your
own personal music that you've imported.

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.309
When you hover over a music entry, you'll see the
play button. You can preview the track.

7
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.886
Click on the check box to import the music into
your recording.

8
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.293
You can always go back to the menu to switch
music, or remove it, by unchecking the currently selected music ...

9
00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:52.442
option.

10
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.570
If you are in the editor, you will also see
an option to add music.

11
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.214
Once you add music to your recording, you can edit
some audio properties by clicking on this icon.

12
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.720
You can increase or decrease the volume.

13
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.491
You can fade the music in or out at the
start and end of the recording.

14
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.648
You can check "ducking" if you also have narration in
the recording. The app will automatically reduce the volume of ...

15
00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:30.552
the music track when narration is active so you can
control the amount it's reduced here.

16
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.897
You can check "normalization" to have the app automatically increase
or decrease the volumes if it's too high or low.

17
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.855
And finally, you can choose to loop the music if
the recording is long than the music track.

18
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.919
These settings will be remembered for this particular music track
so if you use it again in another recording, they ...

19
00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:53.563
will be re-applied.
