00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.600
Let's show you how to adjust layering of multiple overlays.

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.889
By default when you add an overlay to your recording,
it will go on top of previous overlays. For example, ...

3
00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.460
adding this image, after adding the arrow, will result in
the image going on top of the arrow.

4
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.216
Let's change the ordering so we don't cover up the
arrow.

5
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.937
Select "layering" and it will pull up a list of
all the overlays in this recording.

6
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.676
To re-order, simply drag and move the arrow overlay above
the image so it is now on top.  Simple ...

7
00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:37.191
as that!
