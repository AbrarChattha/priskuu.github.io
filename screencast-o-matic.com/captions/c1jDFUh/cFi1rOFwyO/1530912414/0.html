00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.294
First, go to the spot on the timeline where you
want your overlay image to appear.

Locate & Choose an image from your computer and click
"open"

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.312
You can drag the image to position it around your

To resize the overlay, click the "Resize" option and use

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.682
If you want to crop the image, click on "Crop"
and drag the handles around the image.

10
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.573
To zoom in on just a part of the image,
you can do so by dragging the zoom controls here.

11
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.886
To reset the image to its original state, just press
the "reset" button.

12
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.360
Let's set some style properties to the image.

13
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.733
Here, you can apply a few different shapes to the
overlay or a few shadow options.

14
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.800
You can reuse style settings by clicking this button.

15
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.920
It will show previous styles you used,

16
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.850
so you can easily switch back to a particular style
combination. By  default, the overlay will have a transition ...

17
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.321
to fade in and out. You can edit the transition
by clicking on these buttons. You have the option to ...

18
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:26.302
fade, pop or have no transition.

19
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.970
Finally, you can choose to adjust the opacity by using
this slider..

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:39.132
To choose the section of the video your overlay appears,
drag these bars over the timeline to select the start ...

21
00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.171
and end point.

22
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.737
You can also animate the overlay so it changes over
time but we'll cover animation in another tutorial.

23
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.665
Once you're finished and ready to see it in action,
you can preview it by clicking the "Preview" button here.

24
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.671
If that looks good, press the OK button or the
Enter key to save it.

25
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.896
After the overlay image is added to your video, a
colored span will show on your timeline to indicate the ...

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:11.328
placement of this overlay. You can edit the overlay by
