Objects that you blur sometimes move in your video and
you need the blur to track with the object.

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.768
In this tutorial, we will show you how to blur
moving text.

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.956
Let's blur out the words "secret text" in this screen.
As we play the recording, you will see that the ...

4
00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:21.438
text will eventually move off the screen.

5
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:37.841
First, let's set up the area where we want the
blur to start and end.

6
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.925
After we find the exact point we want to start,
click the Tools menu button, then Overlay and Blur option

7
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.617
Once you add this option, a blue span will appear
on your timeline indicating the placement of this blur.

8
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.560
Drag and resize the blur to cover the text.

9
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.724
Next, scroll to the point when the text goes off
the screen.

10
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.144
Again, use the UP arrow key to find the exact
point when the text goes off the screen, then press ...

11
00:01:12.144 --> 00:01:15.895
the "E" key to jump the end of the overlay
span to this point.

12
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.892
We now have the complete span setup to show where
the overlay is needed but if you play the recording, ...

13
00:01:21.892 --> 00:01:27.187
you will see that the blur just stays in one
spot. Let's fix that by moving the blur as well.

14
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.737
First go to the point right before the text starts
moving and again, press the "up" arrow key until we ...

15
00:01:33.737 --> 00:01:34.873
see the text move.

16
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.361
We want to have the blur move at this point
so we click on this circle icon above the timeline, ...

17
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:46.748
which will add an "Edit Point" at this spot. For
more info on Edit Points, see our "Animating Overlays" tutorial.

18
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.729
Next we can reposition the blur by dragging it so
it's over the text.

19
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.475
Press the "UP" arrow key again to find next point
that the text moves, click the circle icon above the ...

20
00:01:57.475 --> 00:02:01.714
timeline to add another edit point, and the drag then
blur again.

21
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.250
We repeat this 3 step process, frame by frame, until
your text moves across the screen.

22
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.300
Now, if we go back and play over the edit
points, we will see the blur moving right along with ...

23
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.840
the text.

24
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.520
When you're done, click "Ok" on the overlay.

25
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.000
