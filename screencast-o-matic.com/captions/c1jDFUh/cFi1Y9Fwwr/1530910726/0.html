Music Intro

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.291
We've made it easy for you to import and export
text and audio into your scripted recording.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.880
Here's the menu to get started on text.

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.401
Text files are plain t-x-t files as shown here. Each
script section is separated by a blank line.

5
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.372
When you are starting with an empty script, you can
import any text file.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.698
If your script already has audio and video, you can
only import a text file with exactly the same number ...

7
00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:36.377
of text sections.  This will replace any current text
you have in your script.

8
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.788
If you want to undo a text, click here to
undo.

9
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.487
You can also export the text from your script as
a captions file.  This file has timestamps when it ...

10
00:00:46.487 --> 00:00:52.609
is displayed on your video.  This is really useful
if you're looking to upload your captions file to another ...

11
00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:53.811
service like YouTube.

12
00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.266
Please note: your captions will only export the sections with
audio or video.  If you have sections where there ...

13
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:04.329
is no audio or video then those will not be
exported.

14
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.890
Let's show you how to import audio into your scripted
recording.

15
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.160
You can import any mp3 or wav files into your
scripted recordings.

16
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.616
For those who have a voiceover, this is the most
convenient way to import your audio.

17
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.280
Click this icon in any given section

18
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.720
Select the audio file that corresponds to that section.

19
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.613
You can also upload an entire audio file in a
scripted recording.  Make sure there is at least two ...

20
00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:40.297
seconds of silence separating each section.  The app will
detect the silence and split the audio into sections.

21
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.681
To do this, click on the import/ export button then
click import audio and choose audio file.

22
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.920
You can then start covering each section with your recording

23
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.560
