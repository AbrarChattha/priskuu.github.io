Hi. My name is Tim Marum. I'm one of the
tech integration specialist at Portsmouth School District.

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.760
Here's how I use slide presentations for class.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:18.148
Now, for instance, I can take a slide deck that
I have created and do a quick voice over.

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.917
Now I can even embed video of myself through a
web cam, put that in there, go through the slide ...

5
00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:30.314
presentation each slide-by-slide and narrate over it.

6
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.724
So I think that's a great approach to get some
kind of content across.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.598
Here's a few tips on how to use Screencast-O-Matic's screen
recorder.

8
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.360
First, make sure that your presentation is set to go.

9
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:55.920
Three, you want to press record.

10
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.796
Four, add extra arrows, transitions, anything else from the video
editor.

Thanks for watching.
