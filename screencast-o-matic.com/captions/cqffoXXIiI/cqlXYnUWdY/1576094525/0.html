Hello everyone, my name is Andrea Cardona and I am
an English as a foreign language teacher in Colombia.

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.915
I have been a teacher for 12 years, 3 of
which I have used flip learning.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.133
One recommendation I have for all of you is: don't
be afraid to flip your classroom,

4
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.744
it may take some time at the beginning but when
you see that the material you use is what will ...

5
00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:25.508
really benefit your students, you will see that it is
all worth it.

6
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.920
My best advice to flip your classroom i

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.960
is to take risks, invest time,

8
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.800
look carefully at the resources you are going to use

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.120
and simply enjoy your classes seeing your students progress

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.240
in class as they hadn't before.
