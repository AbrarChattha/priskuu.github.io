Hello, this is Robert Mayne from Chariho Regional High School
in Southern Rhode Island.

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.350
Right now I want to talk to you about using
video feedback and how effective it can be for students.

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.475
Video mentorship could lead to higher test scores. It could
lead to higher performance within the classroom and it's going ...

4
00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:22.984
to give you a little more time while you're in
the classroom.

5
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.756
It helps you build the connection. What normally what takes
you and the student a lot longer to go through

6
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.800
and get that connection so they understand who you are,

7
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.945
how you are, your personalities. Either way they know who
you are right away.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.680
So give ya a few tips.

9
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.384
Normally, when I used to through and grade stuff from
Algebra 1, and here's a particular example of solving an ...

10
00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:41.855
equation,

11
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.160
I'll go through. Okayâ€¦ we know we need to subtract
two. If I go through and do this in a ...

12
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.682
video. I can go through and I can build the
student's confidence right off the bat by saying, "hey Johnny ...

13
00:00:51.682 --> 00:00:52.531
you did a great job right here.

14
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.320
You subtracted two from both sides, that's the first step.

15
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.844
Then you knew that that was going to be my
first step. Which that means my second step is to ...

16
00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:02.180
isolate the X. So I'm going to divide by three.

17
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.389
But then I can say, you know what though? You
got a little bit of an error here. What should ...

18
00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:11.431
be 5, because 15 divided by 3 is 5, you
made a mistake and you multipled.

19
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.646
So let's make sure that we pay a bit little
bit more attention to detail when we go through this ...

20
00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:16.114
next time."

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.110
That right there would be a lot more effective than
just saying "hey, you earned 3 out of 4 points."

22
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.356
It's all about the learning process, making sure that a
student understands where they went wrong.

23
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.400
And now you have feedback that is effective and timely,

24
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.880
they will learn a lot faster.
