Hi. I'm Andrea Cardona and I have been flipping my
classroom since 2016.

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.176
Recording your lecture and providing them online for your students
is a huge benefit to learning. 

3
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.867
There are a number of benefits of lecture capture. First,
it allows students to rewatch lectures on their own time ...

4
00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:24.905
so they can better understand class topics. 

5
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.210
Second, you never have to repeat yourself again.  Just refer
to the video.

6
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:37.451
But lastly, it gives educators a chance to share work
through online courses, a way for you to catalog your ...

7
00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:40.224
classes and save it for future teachings.

8
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.406
It has helped me a lot because my students need
more one-on-one time with teachers.

9
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.544
Sometimes in class, my students don't get what I'm saying
because it's their first time learning the language.

10
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.760
But, through capturing my lectures it has made their lives
easier.

11
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.370
Here are a few tips to remember when you do
a lecture capture.  

12
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.360
One, be sure to check your camera. 

13
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.357
Check the lighting and camera angles. You want to be sure
that students can see you and any presentations display in ...

14
00:01:13.357 --> 00:01:13.719
class.

15
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.320
Two, audio. 

16
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.385
The audio should be clear enough that it picks up
your audio.  Forget about background noise.

17
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.357
To get the best audio, make sure you have a
microphone that connects to your recording.   

18
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.135
Three, if you had a presentation in your lecture, easily
add it to your video by using the video editor. 

19
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.811
Four, you can save and share your videos on social
sites as well as YouTube or Screencast-O-Matic.

20
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.249
Five, if you want to get a better handle in
organizing your videos, you can use Screencast-O-Matic's hosting services. 

21
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.661
You can create folders which you can label by class
topic.

22
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.942
If a student ever has a question about a certain
topic, you can easily find them here to send them ...

23
00:01:56.942 --> 00:01:57.391
a link.

24
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.383
Lecture captures are great to demonstrate theories, conduct experiments and
answer questions.

25
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.614
It's a cutting edge way to take the traditional university
class beyond the physical classroom.
