Hello, this is Robert Mayne from Chariho High School in
southern Rhode Island.

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.415
With Draw and Zoom, you can draw on the screen
and go over their homework. 

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.240
Just use any of these tools to get it done.

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.208
You can open up a video editor and add video
files or images to illustrate points. 

5
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.821
You can even insert a previous recording of a lecture
so that your students have something to look over.  

6
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.107
After all, the important part of all this making sure
that students understand the grade that they received.

7
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.788
It's all making sure they understanding what they got, where
they went wrong, where they can move forward and how ...

8
00:00:52.788 --> 00:00:56.809
they can make sure to improve their scores or to
improve their knowledge overall.

9
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.800
It builds that connection again.

10
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.360
It's not just some random voice being spoken to them.
