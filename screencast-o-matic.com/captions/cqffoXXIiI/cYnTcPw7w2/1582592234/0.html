00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:20.568

It's an easy 1-2-3 process.

13
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.320
One, you head to the tools.

14
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.788
Second, select the tool that you want to use from
the list.

15
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.680
And three, just implemented right there on the video.

16
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.263
You may have to make some adjustments depending on a
tool that you're using.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.240
