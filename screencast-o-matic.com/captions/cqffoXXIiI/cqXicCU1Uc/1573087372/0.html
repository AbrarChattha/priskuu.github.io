00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:12.360
I'm Angela Barnett and I teach at Willow Elementary School
in the ABC Unified School District in California.

2
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.800
And I'm a third grade teacher.

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.225
So video for me has helped me kind of flip
the tables.

4
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.440
It was actually the first year I got one-to-one chromebooks.

5
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.180
So this was about three years ago and I jumped
from second to third with one-to-one chromebooks and state testing.

6
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.860
And in California it's all digital. it's the CASSPP, the
SBAC.

7
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.249
And knowing that they needed the tech skills along with
knowing how to use technology in an academic way,

8
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.941
I knew I had to do something. I had to
do something to help them be successful because they come ...

9
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:56.190
to me without or hardly any experience  using technology
besides, you know, swiping, touching, exploring.

10
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.675
But once they're with me in third grade  and
I start showing them there's a purpose to it,

11
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.785
they can start solving their own problems, they're curious about
it.

12
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:12.479
It really drives that understanding and use of technology further
for an eight or nine-year-old.

13
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.490
Have students start creating their own videos to share with
their peers.

14
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.467
And what they'll do is, especially in math, what they'll
do is they'll take maybe a whiteboard.

15
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.603
And they'll use the math language to explain their thinking
as they're working out a problem.

16
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.880
And what students can do is check that understanding.

17
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.255
So besides myself checking, their peer will check their work
to see if they can follow their steps to make ...

18
00:01:42.255 --> 00:01:46.259
sure that the students is explaining the steps correctly.

19
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.600
By putting the teaching into the kids' hands,

20
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.922
it drives that student agency, that independence for such a
young age.

21
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.245
And so they love the idea of being able to
share and explain because they're constantly watching other people, or ...

22
00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:06.474
other kids at home do that,

23
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.136
so doing that in an academic way really gives them
purpose using video in the classroom.

24
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.175
At the end of the year it's either sink or
swim

25
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.120
and I wanted them to swim.
