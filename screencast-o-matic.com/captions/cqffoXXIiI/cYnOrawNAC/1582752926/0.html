Hi Screencast-O-Matic fans. My name is Tim Maher and I'm
a tech integration specialist for the Portsmouth Public Schools in ...

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.748
Portsmouth, Rhode Island.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.440
Do you guys have Google?

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.184
We do. In fact, thirty million educators and students are
using the Google for Education platform for class.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.520
For example,

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.331
Here in Portsmouth High School we have a freshman academy,
and we had our ninth grade scholars create video introductions ...

7
00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:32.245
for their peers and their soon-to-be teachers to watch as
a way to make their interests and motivations transparent.

8
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.797
It was in an effort to establish a more personalized
approach to their learning in the school year to come.

9
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.360
We're gonna highlight a few ways you can use video,

10
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.226
and you'll be surprised at all the things you can
do.

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.624
With a Google account, you can sign on into your
Screencast-O-Matic.

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.840
Check it out, it's an easy sign in process.

13
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.840
You can share your videos with a click

14
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760
of this Google Classroom button.

15
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.145
Or, another thing teachers will do is upload to their
Google Drive.

16
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.810
You can also integrate video into all the Google apps.
So let's say you want to add a screencast to ...

17
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.447
a Google Slides presentation.

18
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.800
You can add that.

19
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.160
Just go into your Google Drive and choose that video.

20
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.869
Communication is definitely a big deal, so instead of writing
a lengthy email,

21
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.400
because you know we don't have all the time in
the world to do that and to type it out,

22
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.184
you can add a video into your Gmail. I do
that. I do that with Tim's Tech Tip Thursday, or ...

23
00:01:33.184 --> 00:01:37.166
if I happened to be really good and proactive about
it, I'll do it on Tuesdays.

24
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.360
Tim's Tech Tip Tuesday.

25
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.000
Just email

26
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.640
them a screencast.

27
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.480
Here's a tip to remember: Screencast-O-Matic has a Chromebook app.

28
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.815
So you can launch the free screen recorder anytime you
want.

29
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.723
You can have your students record videos for class projects.
You can download the Chrome extension.

30
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.107
This way it'll be easier for you to launch the
screen recorder or video editor just by clicking here.

31
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.198
Google for Education has made it easier for all of
us to stay organized.

32
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.800
Implementing video is even easier.

33
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.200
Best advice: try something small with one of your classes.

34
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.389
You'll be surprised how much information you'll gather from your
learners in front of you.

35
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.623
Then you'll be able to take that information to help
personalize future topics and assignments based on their interests. Thanks ...

36
00:02:26.623 --> 00:02:27.885
for watching.
