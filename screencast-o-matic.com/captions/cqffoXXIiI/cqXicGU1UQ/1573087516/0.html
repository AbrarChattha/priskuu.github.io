My name is Matthew Moore and I've been flipping since
2012.

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.702
I teach high school mathematics as well as mathematics at
the local community college in Decatur, Illinois.

3
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.147
I think  the biggest thing with bringing technology into
the classroom is understanding that the technology teaches no one.

4
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.575
It's good teaching that must exist first. The technology is
just a means to the end.

5
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.790
And by using some of these key pieces of technology
we can speed up part of the process. We can ...

6
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:39.314
automate part of the process, but in all the key
pieces, it's still is that relationship between teacher and student ...

7
00:00:39.314 --> 00:00:42.912
that must be good and solid that the tech just
enhances.

8
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:51.810
What's really great about moving in the technology is you'd
think that might put space between you and the student.

9
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.751
But what it really does is it puts you on
a more level footing with the student.

10
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.544
Because instead of me worrying about standing and controlling the
classroom from the front with a marker,

11
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.774
or in terms of a lecture where students will engage
or disengage based on length or interest, now we can ...

12
00:01:08.774 --> 00:01:11.700
keep interest engaged with the technology.

13
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.120
We can also keep the relationship...

14
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.740
can be built one-on-one because now instead of sitting face-to-face
we're sitting side-by-side.

15
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.581
And by sitting side-by-side looking at the same technology you
get more of a personal relationship.

16
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.920
And that relationship can last past the high school years.

17
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.934
And I will still get emails from students or I'll
get hit up on Facebook, or on Twitter, etc.

18
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.897
and say, 'hey, so glad we did this because either
the college I'm at requires me how to do this.

19
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.530
Or I've really kind of taken the idea and moved
it into my workplace and do continued training.

20
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.954
And so begin able to do the tech but also
being able to work with people one-on-one or in small ...

21
00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:57.606
groups is key to the process.
