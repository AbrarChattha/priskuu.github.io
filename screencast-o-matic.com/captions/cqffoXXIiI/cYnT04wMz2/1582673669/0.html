Okay Hi. My name is Diana Lorena Cardona.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.547
I'm from Manizales, Colombia and I'm in English teacher in
a bi-national center called Centro Colombo Americano.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.280
I have been flipping since 2016.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.122
You can turn the camera on your students. So let's
get creative. Here are some ways I've engaged my students ...

5
00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.128
by giving them the camera. 

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.583
So I have had my students to create newscasts. So
they just have to work in groups and make their ...

7
00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:29.107
own videos using the topics we have learned in class.

8
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.390
I have also have had my teams to advertise a
company they have created before and so they can take ...

9
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.591
videos and add like all the information they want.

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.678
And I also have had my students record themselves talking
about trips they have done or talking about their experiences, ...

11
00:00:50.678 --> 00:00:52.860
what they liked or what they didn't like

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.298
so like a selfie video in which they can talk
about whatever they want to share with the other students.

13
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:07.141
It's easy for students.  They don't need an account login
to create a screencast.  They can head to the website ...

14
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:09.781
and launch the free screen recorder. 

15
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.558
If you want them to be more creative, Screencast-O-Matic is
extremely affordable.

16
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.600
Students can create with the video editor. 

17
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.662
They can overlay text, add animations and use a green
screen. 

18
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:33.361
Students have produced newscasts, showcased what they did online as
well as create video tutorials on projects.

19
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.360
When it comes to creativity, the possibilities are endless.
