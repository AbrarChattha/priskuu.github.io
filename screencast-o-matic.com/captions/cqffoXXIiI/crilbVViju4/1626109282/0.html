Hi this is Christine with Screencast-O-Matic and I'm going to
show you how to upload videos to hosting.

2
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.320
Use the hosting platform to manage and share your content.

3
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.726
You can upload videos that you have created using our
desktop and mobile apps, or upload directly to the hosting ...

4
00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:23.408
platform.

5
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.280
Click this button to upload your videos.

6
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.680
A new tab will open.

7
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.640
Here, you will find a list of supported formats.

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:41.441
You can drag and drop the videos you would like
to upload, or click the button and select the files.

9
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.200
You will need to keep this tab open while the
videos upload.

10
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.000
You will see a progress bar for the video upload.

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.528
The upload time will vary based on your internet connection
and the file size.

12
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.630
If you would like to cancel an upload, click the
x, here.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.526
Once your video has begun uploading, click the title if
you would like to update it.

14
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.731
Once your video has successfully uploaded, the progress bar will
turn green and a checkmark will be added.

15
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.356
You will then be able to preview the video, copy
a link, or click to edit the video details.

16
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.387
This will open a new tab where you can edit
all of the video information, customize the appearance, and get ...

sharing information
