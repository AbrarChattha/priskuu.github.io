00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.240
I'm Matthew Moore and I've been flipping since 2012.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.640
One of the things that I love about flipping.

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.453
And the things about a digital classroom that make it
so powerful for my students is that I'm allowed to ...

4
00:00:15.453 --> 00:00:16.859
take pieces from everywhere.

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.440
And pull them together.

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.520
And that's where you have.

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.280
Digital Instruction Block.

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.000
Things that are videos that are digitally natively.

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.330
Things that are worksheet that you simply take a digital
picture of or students that produced projects and you bring ...

10
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.863
them in together all of these things can be put
in one place.

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.720
The idea is to think of

12
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.520
each learning component as one individual

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.680
And those individual pieces can be built.

14
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.520
to whatever format you want

15
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.720
The key to this is

16
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.960
Thinking about your class as a whole framework.

17
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.760
Not as an individual activity.

18
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.120
The advantage to this.

19
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.000
combine using.

20
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.160
a Learning Management System

21
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.612
Google classroom or my preferred method Google slides or a
Google Drawing.

22
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.709
If you take these individual components and represent them on
a learning map for example.

23
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.789
Or in some sort of a Google slideshow where each
slide or each item on a slide is another learning ...

24
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:21.464
component.

25
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.843
The key is that students have all the learning in
one place so whether they're learning in the independence either ...

26
00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:33.897
at home or in the school or whether they're in
the group space working together.

27
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.736
All of the components that you asked them to have
or all of the resources that they're going to need ...

28
00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:42.438
are going to be in one spot.

29
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.640
So thinking in terms of digital instruction block.

30
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.387
Means that you can think not in terms of individual
activity.

31
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.120
Framework or a system.

32
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.920
Wherever students are.

33
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.558
Best thing about that is students can learn when or
whn they're ready.
