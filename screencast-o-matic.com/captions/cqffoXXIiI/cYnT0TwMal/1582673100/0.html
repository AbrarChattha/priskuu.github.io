Hi. My name is Nanda Chibanda. And I've been flipping
for the last three years.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:15.823
I work for a bi-national center called Centro Colombo Americano
in Manizales, Colombia and I teach English as a foreign ...

00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:16.426
language.

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.622
Students are always on their phones and they consume video
like crazy. 

5
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.938
Since they are so familiar with video, why not put
that creativity to test on video. 

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.197
Here are a few ways that I've been using video
in the classroom with my students.

7
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.328
You can use it for student assignments so instead of
getting students to give your written assignments why not get ...

8
00:01:23.328 --> 00:01:24.682
them to create a video.

9
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.641
Instead of getting students to present an assignment in class,
why not get them to make a video whether they ...

10
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:33.522
are doing it as individuals or in a group.

11
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.433
You can also use it for projects. So students can
create a video about a certain project that they're going ...

12
00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:46.522
to be doing in class. For example, students can be
told to talk about a trip that they have been ...

13
00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:49.919
on and they can create a whole video around that
trip.

14
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.997
And you can also use it to communicate with your
students. We know that students always have to hand in ...

15
00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:55.789
homework. So why not get your students to give their
homework to you on video.

16
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:02.360
The possibilities are absolutely endless with video.
