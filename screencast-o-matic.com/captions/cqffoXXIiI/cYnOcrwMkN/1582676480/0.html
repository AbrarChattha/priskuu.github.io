My name is Tim Marum.  I'm from the Portsmouth Public
Schools in Rhode Island and I'm a tech integration specialist.

2
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:19.297
So I create video tutorials for professional development. I like
to help other teachers learn tools or methods or processes ...

3
00:00:19.297 --> 00:00:22.595
and video is a great way to showcase it.

4
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.560
So here's a tip I've learned throughout the years-

5
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.268
start small with a topic that educators are really interested
in learning more about.

6
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.381
So this pro tip use the feedback you garnish from
professional learning surveys to inform you on which topic to ...

7
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:38.113
start with first.

8
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.696
Now, these videos they don't have to be complicated, they
don't have to be perfect.  

9
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.658
I typically will actually invite another educator along for the
ride and then share out our video collaboration with all ...

10
00:00:50.658 --> 00:00:51.644
of our colleagues

11
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.800
Each video is unique and definitely not perfect,

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.104
but these imperfections truly provide our audience with a more
authentic capture of our thoughts,

13
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.120
ideas, tips, and pitfalls that we share with one another.

14
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:13.584
To create a video tutorial, here's what you'll need: Number
one, a script or outline of what you want to ...

15
00:01:13.584 --> 00:01:13.995
show.

16
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.320
Number two, a video platform to get it done.

17
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.929
And number three, you need you. You can use your
voice or if you want to show your face, use ...

18
00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.454
a your webcam also. 

19
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.981
There's something in Screencast-O-Matic that makes it easy for you
to create video tutorials.

20
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.800
Have you heard of Scripted Recordings?

21
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:46.344
It's a pretty cool tool. You can copy and paste
your script here and it breaks it up into sections. 

22
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.977
You don't need to memorize your script or post it
up next to your camera… just paste it in here ...

23
00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:54.804
and record the video tutorial section by section.

24
00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:07.272
You can record your audio and then add your screen recording,
images, overlays, even video files.

25
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.240
There's an easy import button to add text files.

26
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.168
Or better yet, if you don't like your voice, you
can add audio narration mp3s into these sections.

27
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.920
It takes a bit of prep but it's worth it. 

28
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.962
You can reuse these videos over and over again. And
if you want to update it, just highlight the section ...

29
00:02:27.962 --> 00:02:28.842
and replace it.

30
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.784
You don't have to re-record the whole thing over again.
Scripted Recordings has saved me a ton of time when ...

31
00:02:35.784 --> 00:02:39.711
creating video tutorials.  It's just easier to put together.

32
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.342
Again, these don't have to perfect. The important thing to
remember is to get your points across.

33
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.583
So best advice -- don't go at this alone! Grab
a colleague to co-create a video tutorial and share it ...

34
00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:55.956
out to the rest of the world.

35
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.720
Thanks for watching.
