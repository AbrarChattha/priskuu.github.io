Hi I'm Angela Burnett and I'm an elementary school teacher
from

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.320
California.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.344
Let's face it, as educators we all know students learn
in different ways so it's extremely important

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.840
that you create content that's accessible.

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.381
It plays a huge role in allowing students equal opportunity
to understand and engage with class topics.

6
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.560
Video content needs to have captions.

7
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.480
It's easy to create captions on Screencast-O-Matic.

8
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.513
There are four ways you can create video captions. Number
one: blank captions.

9
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.420
You can type in your own captions right into the
captions editor.

10
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.160
Number two:

11
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.360
From text file.

12
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.809
You can also import your own text file which is
fairly easy to do.

13
00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.212
And number three speech-to-text technology. And then this is really
cool all you need to do is talk and it ...

14
00:01:00.212 --> 00:01:07.398
will type it out for you. Another cool thing is
that the technology can identify other languages to caption.

15
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.400
And number four: scripted recordings.

16
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.517
Now if you use scripts to create your videos and
are already using the scripted recording feature on Screencast-O-Matic, then ...

17
00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:24.673
you don't need to worry about creating captions. It will
already be done with the script you've already created.

18
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.384
Here are a couple expert tips to remember while you
caption.

19
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.330
Make sure your captions sync with your audio. All you
need to do is head into your captions editor and ...

20
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.377
use the sync points to make adjustments.

21
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.678
These time codes are fairly easy to track the audio
on your video. Just click on it and it will ...

22
00:01:43.678 --> 00:01:44.885
take you right there.

23
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.241
You can add multiple languages to your video for closed
captioning. Right before you upload your video you'll have the ...

24
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:48.876
option to pick your captions.

25
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:59.730
Accessibility in the classroom is extremely important for students. By
adding captions, you help students access, understand, and engage with ...

26
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.612
your videos.
