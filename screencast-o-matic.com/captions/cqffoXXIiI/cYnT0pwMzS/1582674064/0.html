Hi I'm Matthew Moore and I've been flipping since 2012.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.574
We need to talk about the Google Chrome Extension. And
if students download this, what it'll do is...

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.666
it'll take an icon, put hit right up in their
address bar.

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.407
So every time you or they need to use the
Screencast-O-Matic tool, it's right there for them.

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.856
And so by using this extension, all they have to
do by clicking that icon, it launches the recording system ...

6
00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:34.419
and the editor.

7
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.255
So all of the things you want to do in
your classroom whether it's an assignment, a screen recording, a ...

8
00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:46.512
group project or anything else-- it's right there and available
for students.

9
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:54.900
The other advantage to this is that  if you
can train the students to use one program primarily that ...

10
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.291
means every student is on the same footing.

11
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.834
And it means as a teacher you can go through
one tool that is both powerful enough to do what ...

12
00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:03.362
you want,

13
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.737
but also easy enough for students to use so that
anytime you want to pull this out either in your ...

14
00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:10.389
classroom,

15
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.560
or when your students are at home,

16
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.416
or if they're in a group project or working by
themselves it's as easy as clicking that icon.

17
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.360
So, another great tip for you.
